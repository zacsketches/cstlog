# cstlog
Minimal logging package that wraps [github.com/apex/log](github.com/apex/log) for logging in U.S. central time.

I have a few private projects that I monitor and I find myself frequently trying to convert UTC into my local time instead of concentrating on what I'm seeing in the logs. So, I decided to make life easier and just start loggin in my own timezone.
